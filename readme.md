# Lightweight New Tab Page

I don't like the default new tab, and I haven't found a different one that added any more value for me than the default. So I made a ridiculously simple page of my own.

# Installation

To install, download `chrome-new-tab-extension.crx`. Go to chrome://extensions (just paste that in your address bar.) Drag the file into that window.

It loads in around 50ms if it hasn't been loaded in a while (the default takes around 500). This may not matter to some people, but to me it's important. Plus, I don't need it phoning home every time I open a new browser tab.

I plan to add some lightweight customization options in the future, so you can add your own quick links, and a nice recently closed tab recovery section. But it's never going to get a big feature list with a weather widget and flickr photos and that nonsense. It's just going to be a straightforward new tab page for people who like that sort of thing.
