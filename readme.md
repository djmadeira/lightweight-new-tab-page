# Lightweight New Tab Page

I don't like the default new tab, and I haven't found a different one that added any more value for me than the default. So I made a ridiculously simple page of my own.

# Installation

Install from the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lightweight-new-tab-page/cahfgmimpeeiibiicmeengglhpnhbkki), or you can [build it from source](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging).

# Planned features

I always plan to keep this simple & fast, so I won't add a ton of features. I'm open to good ideas, but ultimately this is for me. That said, this is licensed under WTFPL; if you want to change it, be my guest!
